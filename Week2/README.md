# Week 2 – CS50x Problem Sets

This directory contains my solutions to the **Week 2** problem sets from **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**.

Week 2 focuses on key programming concepts that expand on what was learned in Week 1, especially **arrays**, **strings**, and deeper use of the C language toolchain.

---

## Topics Covered

Throughout Week 2, the following concepts and tools are introduced and explored:

- **Command-line tools and compilation process** (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking, and debugging)
- **Arrays** – sequences of elements stored contiguously in memory
- **Strings** – arrays of characters with indexing and manipulation  
- **Command-line arguments** for programs 
- Additional practice with loops, conditions, and program structure
- Introduction to simple cryptography concepts (applied in some problem sets){index=6}

## Problem Sets

This directory contains subdirectories for each Week 2 problem set. Each subdirectory holds the C source code that solves the respective problem.

Common themes across problem sets include:

- Utilizing **arrays** and **loops**  
- Processing **strings** and user input  
- Applying problem-solving strategies learned in lecture

## Notes

- All solutions are written as part of CS50x coursework.  
- Completed problem sets demonstrate understanding of Week 2 topics and C programming techniques.
