# Week 1 – C

This directory contains my solutions to **Week 1** problem sets from **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**.

Week 1 introduces the C programming language and builds upon core programming concepts first learned using Scratch.

---

## Topics Covered

- Writing and compiling C programs
- Using the command line
- Header files and libraries (`stdio.h`, `cs50.h`)
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals and logical operators
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Functions and abstraction
- Correctness, design, and style
- Comments and code readability
- Operators, truncation, and type limits

## Problem Sets

### Mario – Single Pyramid (`mario-less`)
- Prints a **right-aligned pyramid** of hashes (`#`) based on user input.  
- Practiced **nested loops**, **input validation**, and **formatting output**.

### Mario – Double Pyramid (`mario-more`)
- Prints **two pyramids side by side** based on user input:  
  - The **first pyramid is right-aligned**  
  - The **second pyramid is left-aligned**  
- Practiced **nested loops**, **input validation**, and **formatting output**.

### Cash
- Calculates the **minimum number of coins** needed for change.  
- Used **conditionals**, **loops**, and arithmetic operations.

### Credit
- Validates credit card numbers using **Luhn’s Algorithm**.  
- Identifies card types (AMEX, MasterCard, Visa) based on number patterns and validity.

## Notes

- All solutions are written by me as part of the CS50x course.  
- Code is evaluated with an emphasis on **correctness**, **design**, and **style**.  
- This work is for educational purposes and follows CS50’s academic honesty policy.
